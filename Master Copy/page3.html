											Being a server administrator for a virtual machine hosted server was tough.<br>
											It was the first time I had to work directly with a command line only.<br>
											I also gained some understanding of editing bat and config files.<br>
											On the gaming end of Minecraft I was also well renowned for beating some<br>
											of the hardest content and mod collections that have been created.<br>
											Including, Terrafirmacraft, Blood n' Bones, and the easier FTB unleashed.
