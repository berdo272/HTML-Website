				<span class="bodyparagraph">When I first started playing Dungeon Defenders I fell in love with it. <br>
											I maxed out each of the classes with each content update,<br>
											and quickly reached the frontline of players beating new content.<br>
											When the Tredny looked to their player base for help beta testing,<br>
											I quickly jumped at the opporunity to get invloved shaping the game.<br>
											Dungeon Defenders 1 was my first 100% completion game on steam.<br>
											This was the accumulation of over 1,000 hours of gameplay, and I was one of less than 100 to do it.<br>
											I saw through the early stages of the development of their second game,<br>
											and lent my expertise in MOBA style games to its development until that half of the project was canned.
