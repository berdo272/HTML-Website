				<span class="bodyparagraph">I have been a league of legends player since its release to closed beta in early 2000.<br>
											I was very interested in League due to its large presence of META game experience.<br>
											I quickly ascended the ranked North American ladder and have since maintained high ratings.<br>
											My highest rating acheived has been the top 3% overall. <br>
											I participated and placed 3rd in a milwuakee area collegiate tournament. <br>
											It has continued to be one of my all time favorite games.
