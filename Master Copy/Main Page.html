				<span class="bodyparagraph">I have been a semiprofessional gamer since 2008. <br>
											I first got interested in gaming with the advent of the warcraft 3 mod DOTA.<br>
											I maintained a #1 rating on a ranked ladder for 5 years in dota.<br>
											I was then admitted into the closed beta for League of Legends. <br>
											More recently I have spent time administrating and moderating for several Minecraft servers. <br>
											I also have an extensive library of steam games, but one that stands out as a pinnacle of my gaming career was Dungeon Defenders.<br>
											I worked in a closed remote quality assurance team with developers to shape new content,<br>
											as well as to lay foundations for their sequel Dungeon Defenders 2.
